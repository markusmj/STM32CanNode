# STM32CanNode

This project will make a simple Can Node which will read 10 analog inputs and sen their data to Canbus. 

Idea is also to build simple connecting PCB where common and cheap STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill Development Board and MCP2515+TJA1050 Can shield can be used to create compact package with Analog/digital read and Can capabilities.
